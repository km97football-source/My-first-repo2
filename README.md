# **MY GREATEST FEAR** 
# <ins>What is my fear</ins>
# *paragraph 1*
 *A fear i have struggled with for a long time in my short life, would be fear of failing at things that have a good toll on my future. Most times i seem to worry a lot about faling a test or not being prepared for a presentaion or exam.*

# *paragraph 2*
 This fear has been present for most of my life and to curb it i usually try to see exams and tests as something fun and a challenge, so that rather than being afraid of it i would be excited which would also improve my ability to understand concepts for the exam or test as a popular saying "is the only thing we have to fear is fear itself."
 # *Final paragraph*
 In conclusion i have had a lot of fears over the span of my life but i have learned from them and it has made me a better person in general.
